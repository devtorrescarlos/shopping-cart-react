## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I improved my skills manipulating the state with React, also, I've implemented customs Hooks to make my code more clean. Using Tailwind CSS is a good way to gain time when you are doing the UI, that is why I implemented it. Finally, I need to improve the performance of the application with regard to images.
